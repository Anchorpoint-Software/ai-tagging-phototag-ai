# Tag and Add Descriptions to Assets Using PhotoTag.ai

This action allows you to add Anchorpoint Attributes (Descriptions, Titles, Keywords, and Tags) using the PhotoTag.ai API.

## How to Install This Action

1. Copy the URL of this repository.
2. In Anchorpoint, go to "Workspace Settings" â†’ "Actions."
3. Click on "Import" and paste the URL into the field.

## Configure and Use the Action

Once the action is imported, you should see a "Settings" button when you hover over it. Open the settings to configure the action.

### Adding an API Key

The first thing you need to do is add an API key, which you get from the [PhotoTag.ai](http://PhotoTag.ai) website. Once added, an info box will display how many credits you have.

### Configuring the Settings

You will find five settings groups: Keywords Settings, Description Settings, Title Settings, Additional Settings, and AI Attributes. By default, the entries are empty and PhotoTag.ai will use its default values. You might need to do some trial and error to find what works best for you.

**AI Attributes**

Here you can enable which Anchorpoint Attributes will be created.
- AI-Title and AI-Description are text fields.
- AI-Tags will create a multiple-choice tag.

### Storing Settings as Templates

You can store different settings as templates and use them when triggering the action on your files.

## Using the Action

Select a few files and apply the action from the context menu. You can then choose which settings template should be applied for tagging the files. The attributes will be added file by file.
